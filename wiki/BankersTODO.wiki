#summary Things I want to do to the Bankers tutorial.

* let the user change some of the code, e.g. times of work
* indicate on GUI when a burglary takes place (could use static agent if I can't get Simphony to do this properly).
* generally make the tutorial easier: more description of what the code does, lower entry point for students.
* Use build targets so students can revert to a previous version if they break something.
